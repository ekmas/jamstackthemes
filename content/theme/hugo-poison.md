# A clean, professional Hugo theme

*Poison* is a **clean**, **professional** Hugo theme designed to **captivate** your readers.

It's also **tiny** and **privacy conscious** with *no external dependencies* (unless you opt to include comments). No JavaScript frameworks, icon packs, or Google fonts. No ads or trackers polluting your console window.

**We kept things simple**. A little vanilla JavaScript, a dash of CSS, and the power of Hugo.

All the static assets for the site (JS files, CSS, and fonts) are kept in the theme's */assets/* directory. **That way you know *exactly* what's going on your site**.
